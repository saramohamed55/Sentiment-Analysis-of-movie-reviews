Step 1: Data Preprocessing

Load the movie review dataset
Remove stop words, punctuations, and convert text to lowercase
Tokenize the text data
Perform stemming or lemmatization on the tokenized text data
Step 2: Feature Extraction

Use TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into a numerical feature vector.
Step 3: Model Selection and Training

Select a classification model, such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Train the model using the training data
Evaluate the model accuracy on the testing data
Step 4: Model Tuning

Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter for Logistic Regression, or the smoothing factor for Naive Bayes
Evaluate the model accuracy on the testing data after tuning
Step 5: Generate Classification Results

Use the best model to classify the sentiment of the movie reviews
